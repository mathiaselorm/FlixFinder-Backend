    "Stage 2: Preparing and Analyzing the Data\n",
    "1. Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle Missing Values: We ensured data integrity by addressing missing values across our datasets. We used various strategies like filling in missing values with mean, median, or mode, and removing rows or columns with excessive missing data. This step is crucial to avoid any bias or errors in model performance that could arise from incomplete data.\n",
    "Remove Duplicates: Duplicate entries were identified and removed. This is important to prevent any skew in the analysis, ensuring that each data point represents a unique instance, thus maintaining the quality of the dataset.\n",
    "Data Type Conversions: We converted data into appropriate formats, such as transforming timestamps from strings to datetime objects. Proper data types are essential for correct and efficient processing of data in subsequent analysis and modeling steps.\n",
    "Validity Checks: We performed checks to ensure that all data adheres to expected formats and ranges. This step helps in maintaining the consistency and accuracy of the dataset, preventing anomalies that could impact analysis and decision-making.\n",
    "2. Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Summaries: We used descriptive statistics to gain an overview of the data—calculating means, medians, ranges, variances, and standard deviations of key numeric columns. This helps in understanding the central tendencies and dispersion of data, which are critical for informing further analysis and model preparation.\n",
    "Distribution Analysis: We analyzed the distributions of key variables using histograms, box plots, and kernel density estimates. This was done to understand the spread and central tendencies of the data, identifying any biases or skewness that could affect model performance.\n",
    "Correlation Analysis: Relationships between different data features were explored, particularly how user attributes relate to their movie ratings. We used correlation matrices and scatter plots to identify and visualize these relationships, providing insights that could help in feature selection for modeling.\n",
    "Outlier Detection: We identified outliers that could potentially skew the results of our recommendation algorithms. Handling outliers is crucial as they can significantly affect the model’s accuracy and the quality of recommendations.\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata Utilization: We used movie metadata to create new features that describe each movie's characteristics. This included one-hot encoding of genres to convert categorical genre data into a numerical format, facilitating the modeling process.\n",
    "Interaction Features: Features were developed from user interactions, such as average and median ratings per user, and total number of ratings per movie. These features help capture personal rating behaviors and preferences, which are critical for building personalized recommendation systems.\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction: We considered reducing the number of features using techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) if the feature space was too large. This helps in simplifying the model without losing significant information, improving both efficiency and performance.\n",
    "4. Advanced Features (Considered)\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Features: We explored the potential of incorporating temporal dynamics of ratings, which could help capture trends or changes in user preferences over time. This is particularly useful for systems where user preferences may evolve.\n",
    "Textual Analysis: We considered using natural language processing to extract sentiment or topics from movie descriptions or reviews, which could serve as additional features. This approach can add a layer of depth to the recommendations by understanding the content and context of user feedback.\n",
    "This comprehensive documentation of Stage 2 ensures that each step taken enhances the dataset's readiness for modeling, setting a solid foundation for developing effective and robust recommendation algorithms."
