    "Stage 3 Documentation: Developing the Model\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "This document outlines the procedures followed in Stage 3 of developing the movie recommendation system, specifically focusing on model selection, training, evaluation, and optimization to ensure effective recommendation outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Selection\n",
    "Algorithm Used: SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)\n",
    "Purpose: SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into singular vectors and singular values. It is chosen for its effectiveness in capturing latent factors underlying the interactions between users and items, making it ideal for collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training the Model\n",
    "Data Splitting: The dataset was split into training and testing sets to ensure that the model could be trained on one subset of the data and validated on another to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "Training Process: The model was trained on the training set, learning to associate user and item interactions with ratings.\n",
    "Purpose: Training the model allows it to learn from historical data, understanding user preferences and item characteristics that drive rating behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation\n",
    "Metrics Used: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error)\n",
    "Evaluation Process: The trained model was evaluated on the testing set to assess its prediction accuracy.\n",
    "Purpose: Evaluation helps to quantify how well the model performs in predicting unseen data, providing a metric to gauge the effectiveness of the model in capturing the underlying data patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Optimization\n",
    "Parameter Tuning: Utilized GridSearchCV to explore different combinations of hyperparameters to find the optimal settings for the SVD algorithm.\n",
    "Optimized Parameters: Included variations in the number of epochs, learning rates, and regularization terms.\n",
    "Purpose: Model optimization aims to fine-tune the parameters of the model to enhance performance, reducing prediction errors and improving overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Model Validation\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Conducted cross-validation by partitioning the data into multiple subsets, ensuring that the model performs consistently across different data splits.\n",
    "Stress Testing: Tested the model with edge cases and unusual data inputs to assess its robustness and response to atypical conditions.\n",
    "Purpose: These final validation steps ensure the model is robust, performs consistently under different scenarios, and is ready for deployment in a production environment."
